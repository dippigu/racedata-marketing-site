{{< faq "How is the database updated daily?" >}} The RaceData team crunch the number, upadte our system database, and package up an update every day. This update file is hosted on our cloud based server and the RaceData application connects to our server to download the updated database file. The RaceData application updates the database in the background so you never get interrupted.  {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "Will I make money using RaceData?" >}} RaceData can't tell you which horse is going to win each race, so it's still up to you to do some work. What it can do is help you find and visualise the relevant data that allows you to make a much more informed decision about what you think will win the race.  {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "How long do I need to subscribe for?" >}} We believe that in order to fully appreciate the power of RaceData, you really need to use it frequently for up to three months. For that reason, the minimum subscription term is 3 months, after which it becomes a monthly rolling subscription. {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "Is there a mobile RaceData app?" >}} Not yet, but there will be. We've been concentrating on building the Windows based version of RaceData first as that is where we believe most of our users will want to use it. We already have a long roadmap of new features planned for development, and a mobile app is certainly amongst them. Watch this space for further details. {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "Can I get a refund?" >}} We'd rather you didn't want to. But seriously, if you really feel that RaceData has not been good value for money, [contact us](contact). {{</ faq >}}

{{< faq "What's the difference between Lite and Pro?" >}} The Lite ratings system gives you indicators based on the past performance of each horse in various categories, including Going, Weight, Class, and Distance. The Pro ratings system gives you a carefully calculated rating for multiple factors, using data compiled fromeach horses form history.

The Pro package also enables access to more detailed form history, report building and exports, and more. {{</ faq >}}
